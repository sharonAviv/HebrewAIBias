NOTES

This dataset contains the variables corresponding to questions asked in the survey. It also contains administrative data, such as the main production weight and completion date. There are several types of additional variables that we can typically provide upon request, if they were created for published reporting: 
(1) Researcher-created variable(s) reflecting how we categorized responses to open-ended questions. We do not release verbatim answers to open-ended questions, in the interest of protecting panelist anonymity.
(2) Researcher-created variables needed to replicate published analysis (e.g., an index using several questions).
(3) Special weights needed to replicate published analysis. The main production weight is included in the public dataset. Special weights refer to those used for unusual, bespoke analysis. We can provide existing special weights upon request so long as the analysis they support does not pose a risk to panelist anonymity. 
If you would like to request any of these variables, or have any questions, please reach out to us at info@pewresearch.org.

PRESWITHOP/OPWITHPRES 
For panelist experience purposes, we asked both PRESWITHOP and OPWITHPRES of all respondents in order to give them the opportunity to weigh in on both parties. However, these items are subject to strong order effects, so we only analyzed data based on the item asked first. In all cases, form I respondents received PRESWITHOP first and form II respondents received OPWITHPRES first. For reporting purposes, PRESWITHOP is based on FORM=1; OPWITHPRES is based on FORM=2.

INSTN/INSTN2
INSTN and INSTN2 were asked as part of an experiment, where respondents were shown either INSTN or INSTN2, with Form 1 being shown INSTN and Form 2 being shown INSTN2. INSTN is a trend question, and researchers asked INSTN2 to see how responses shifted with a four-point scale instead of a two-point scale. Reporting and analysis are based on the INSTN questions (asked of Form 1 only), in order to preserve the trend on this set. 

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.
