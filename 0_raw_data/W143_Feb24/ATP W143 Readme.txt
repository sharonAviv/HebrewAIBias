NOTES

This dataset contains the variables corresponding to questions asked in the survey. It also contains administrative data, such as the main production weight and completion date. There are several types of additional variables that we can typically provide upon request, if they were created for published reporting: 
(1) Researcher-created variable(s) reflecting how we categorized responses to open-ended questions. We do not release verbatim answers to open-ended questions, in the interest of protecting panelist anonymity.
(2) Researcher-created variables needed to replicate published analysis (e.g., an index using several questions).
(3) Special weights needed to replicate published analysis. The main production weight is included in the public dataset. Special weights refer to those used for unusual, bespoke analysis. We can provide existing special weights upon request so long as the analysis they support does not pose a risk to panelist anonymity. 
If you would like to request any of these variables, or have any questions, please reach out to us at info@pewresearch.org.

Wave 143 includes oversamples from KnowledgePanel (KP), Opinion Panel (OP), and AmeriSpeak. A set of questions are asked only of the oversample respondents towards the end of the survey. They are used for weighting and analytical purposes. They align with existing measurements for ATP respondents so that the samples can be combined. The public use dataset does not contain these raw demographic questions. Instead, demographic information from KP, OP, AmeriSpeak, and ATP respondents are combined into variables denoted with “F_” (e.g. F_GENDER, F_AGECAT) and can be found towards the end of the variable list in the dataset.

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

ARABID is excluded from the dataset in accordance with our privacy policy.
