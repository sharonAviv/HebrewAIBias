NOTES

For a small number of respondents with high risk of identification, certain values have been randomly swapped with those of lower risk cases with similar characteristics.

The W105 dataset contains two created variables, FPKNOW_W105 and FPKNOW_SUM_W105.
Variable FPKNOW_W105 is a flag to count the number of foreign policy knowledge questions answered correctly. There are 12 questions included in this series: NATO_KNOW through AFRICA_COUNTRIES. SPSS syntax to compute this variable is included in the SYNTAX section below. 
Variable FPKNOW_SUM_W105 is a summary of the above FPKNOW_W105 variable. SPSS syntax to compute this variable is included in the SYNTAX section below.

The W105 dataset contains appended variables from W63.5, W91, and W104 on foreign policy attitudes, opinions of China, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
